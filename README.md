## Description

School project (Noroff), 

This is a list of the tasks we were given:

- Create either a new React or Next.js app in this repo.
- For the login functionality, use a Wordpress installation with the JWT plugin from Module 3.
- The app should have the following paths:
    "/"
    "/detail/:param"
    "/contact"
    "/login"
    "/admin"
- Home page: Find an API that returns at least:
    an array of items
    a single item retrieved by a parameter (id, name, slug, etc)
- Detail page:
    Retrieve the parameter from the URL and use it in an API call to fetch one item.
    Display at least 3 properties from the item.
- Contact page:
    Create a form with inputs and validation
- Login page:
    Create a form with username/email and password fields.
- Admin page:
    This page will simply display an "Admin" heading.
